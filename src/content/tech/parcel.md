I find Parcel great for quick prototyping and small projects.

Parcel is a web application bundler, differentiated by its developer experience. It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration. Parcel can take any type of file as an entry point and outputs bundled, minified, and optimized code ready for production.
