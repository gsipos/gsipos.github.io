I've used Firebase for rapid application development with ready-made backend services.

Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, and creating marketing and product experiments. Its core services include real-time database, authentication, and hosting.
