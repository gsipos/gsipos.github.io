Vite (French for "quick") is a modern build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. Created by Evan You, the author of Vue.js, Vite leverages native ES modules to offer lightning-fast cold server starts, near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR), and true on-demand compilation. It supports various frameworks including React, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript, making it an excellent choice for modern web projects.
