I've used Google App Engine for deploying and scaling web applications without managing infrastructure.

Google App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. You can choose from several popular languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop your apps, and App Engine will take care of provisioning servers and scaling your app instances based on demand.
