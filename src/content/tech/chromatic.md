Chromatic is a visual testing and review platform built by the team behind Storybook. It automates visual regression testing by capturing screenshots of your Storybook components and comparing them across commits to detect visual changes. Chromatic streamlines UI review workflows with features like UI review tools, component documentation hosting, and collaborative feedback. It helps teams catch visual bugs before they reach production, ensuring consistent UI appearance across different browsers and devices.
