Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation, perfect for building and documenting component libraries. It provides a sandbox environment where developers can create, test, and showcase components independently from the main application. With features like interactive controls, accessibility testing, responsive viewport preview, and extensive addon ecosystem, Storybook streamlines component development workflows and facilitates collaboration between designers and developers.
