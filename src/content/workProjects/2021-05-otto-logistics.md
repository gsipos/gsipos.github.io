At OTTO we are developing web applications, and software components, which ingest data from various sources. Everything is hosted on GCP. We are supporting OTTO's digital transformation in the logistics department in multiple domains. One of them is reverse inbound, where we are implementing the digital administration of goods, which need to be sent back to the supplier.
