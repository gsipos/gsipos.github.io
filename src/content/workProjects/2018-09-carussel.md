Carussel is a full-scope digital marketing agency that specializes in automotive marketing and works for international clients across multiple countries. In this project, we created modular UI and backend components for an existing CMS system, and delivered a modern and fast web application while incrementally migrating from the preexisting CMS frontend and backend. These components served as new products for the company that can be easily inserted in existing external websites.

We are also continuously improving the system architecture, the development workflow and enhancing the build and deploy processes.
