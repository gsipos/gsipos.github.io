If you’re new to application development on GCP, we’ll show you two different approaches to build simple applications.

### For a client

We were supporting an enterprise client in their rip and replace migration into the cloud.
We built a simple and compelling application for them, making use of GCP best practices as much as possible.
Tech stack spoiler: terraform, Java17, Spring Boot, Cloud Run, GCS, CloudSQL, Cloud Tasks and other GCP services

### For ourselves

If you’re considering starting a relatively small project, and wondering what tools to choose to deliver quickly and efficiently, we’ll show you our recently started app: EMMA.
EMMA is an in-house initiative for our employees supporting a variety of company processes.
It is built on our preexisting choice of tools, combining them into a unified experience.
Since EMMA is an internal tool, our development focus is on delivering value with relatively small effort.
Tech stack spoiler: React, TypeScript, Material UI, Vercel, Firebase, GCP
